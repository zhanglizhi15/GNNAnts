# Table 4: Peak GPU memory consumption

To denote the trend of the increased memory consumption we increase the number of batches and batches.
The hyperparameter is as follows: 2,3,4-layer GraphSAGE + LSTM aggregator with 32, 64 ,128 batches on arxiv dataset.

After `./test_mini.sh; ./test_betty.sh; ./test_gnnants.sh` you can get the results in folder `log/`
